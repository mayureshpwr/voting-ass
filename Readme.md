# Nefi Contract

## Prerequisites

To run and test the contract locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or above)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- Hardhat (already configured in the project)

---


## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Since the repository already contains the `node_modules` folder, this step is not necessary. However, if you want to reinstall the dependencies, run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies such as Hardhat and OpenZeppelin contracts.

### 2. Running the Tests

The contract has already been compiled, so you just need to run the tests to ensure everything works correctly. The tests are located in the `test` folder:

To run the tests:

1. Navigate to the project directory where the contract is located:

    ```bash
    cd C:\blockchain projects\NEFi.TESTING
    ```

2. Run the test cases using the following command:

    ```bash
    npx hardhat test/ test filename 
    ```
